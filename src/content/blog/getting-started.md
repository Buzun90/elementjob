## What is INDUSTRONIX?
INDUSTRONIX is Astro theme created for e-commerce tailored to single product.
It's a quick starter for you to save time on development.
You can use it with any serverless provider like VERCEL, Netlify, Deno Deploy, Github Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.

## What is Astro?
Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. Astro works a lot like a static site generator. If you have ever used Eleventy, Hugo, or Jekyll (or even a server-side web framework like Rails, Laravel, or Django) then you should feel right at home with Astro.

> You can find full Astro documentation [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
