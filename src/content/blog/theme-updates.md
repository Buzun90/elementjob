## How to update?
Firstly, when new update is available you have to download .zip file with updated content from ThemeForest.

Now, all you have to do is to delete your old INDUSTRONIX folder and replace it with new one.

Thatâ€™s it, reconfigure and build your site again and changes should be visible.
