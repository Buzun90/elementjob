## Demo

ðŸ“Œ [https://industronix.mcstech.dev/](https://industronix.mcstech.dev/)

<br>

## Getting started

**Industronix** tries to give you quick access to create a website using [Astro 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a industrial theme focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals..

â”‚   â”‚   â””-- config.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ news/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [category]/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [tag]/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [page].astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 404.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œ-- rss.xml.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/

â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ site.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Theming capabilities

With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML. By using utility classes in this way, you can build custom designs without writing CSS. Without a framework like Tailwind, you have to keep writing CSS as you add new features and components. As a result, your CSS files continue to grow and get heavier. By using utilities like Tailwindâ€™s flexbox and padding utilities, most styles are reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS. You can easily copy existing components and start tweaking them up to reach what you need.

##### Color scheme

You can do this in `src/styles/base.css` file. In Industronix theme, :root and html[data-theme="light"] selectors are used as the primary color scheme. If you want to customize your custom color scheme, you have to specify your light color scheme inside `:root,html[data-theme="light"]`.

Colors are declared in CSS custom property (CSS Variable) notation. Color property values are written in rgb values. (Note: instead of rgb(40, 39, 40), only specify 40, 39, 40).

Here is the detail explanation of color properties.

| Color Property       | Definition & Usage                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-fill`       | Primary color of the website. |

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
